Enhanced Diagnostic Summary
---------------------------
Content Security Policy (CSP) Issue:
The application in static/chat.js is experiencing a Content Security Policy violation at line 260.
The inline style for the handleFileUpload function is being refused because it violates the default-src directive "self" and "https://liveonshuffle.com".
To enable inline execution, one must either:
  - Allow 'unsafe-inline' in the CSP,
  - Use a valid hash (sha256-NjYDAvf3Yswi9GqXn8q5mE3okYa3Q4PuzJ0DkAhe4yQ=),
  - Or use a nonce value.
Note: Using a hash does not cover event handlers, style attributes, or javascript: navigations unless 'unsafe-hashes' is also specified.

HTTP 500 Error During Chat Operation:
At static/chat.js line 66, a POST request to https://liveonshuffle.com/chat resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error.
The sendMessage function (referenced at lines 66, 102, and 507) logged "Error sending message: Error: HTTP error! status: 500",
indicating a failure in HTTP communication, possibly due to:
  - Server or network timeout issues,
  - Misconfiguration with the Azure OpenAI API.

Server and API Communication Log Highlights:
- 04:18:09: Chat request received (session ID: 80e5ffa6-ca70-47d7-aa4d-6538b635df25).
- 04:18:39: Retry for /chat/completions after 0.432869 seconds.
- 04:18:43: Successful POST at Azure endpoint with HTTP 200.
- 04:18:43: File upload for "o1 and o3.txt" recorded.
- 04:18:50: New chat request received.
- 04:19:20, 04:19:51, and 04:20:22: Subsequent retries recorded.
- 04:20:53: Final error logged with "500: Error communicating with Azure OpenAI service".
- The UI displayed "Could not send message. Please try again."

Additional Diagnostic Note:
The error occurred during the file upload of a .txt file. Verify that the API accepts .txt files and that file upload limitations are not being exceeded.

Overall Recommendations:
1. Update the Content Security Policy to properly allow inline styles using a nonce, valid hash (with 'unsafe-hashes' if needed), or 'unsafe-inline'.
2. Review the server configuration and network conditions affecting the HTTP request to the chat endpoint and Azure OpenAI API.
3. Confirm that file uploads (specifically .txt files) are supported and correctly processed.
